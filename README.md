# Mesoscale-Modeling-of-the-mouse-brain

- curbd_code.py: File to run the Current Based Decomposition technique given any activity data (saves the interaction matrix and loss values after every epoch)
- JMatrixBehaviour.ipynb: Plot the J matrix values as a histogram to see their distribution
- loading_data-newmouse.ipynb: Read the activity data from the files and apply gaussian on it
- InteractionMatrix_plot.ipynb: Plot the interaction matrices based on the area/peak channels.
